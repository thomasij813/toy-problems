/* 
Merge two Linked Lists at alternating positions
Objective: Given two linked lists, merge one list into another at alternate
positions, if second link list has extra nodes, print them as well

Example:
5 -> 10 -> 15 -> 20 ->25 -> null
3 -> 6 ->9 -> 12 ->15 ->18 ->21 -> null

Output :
5 -> 3 -> 10 -> 6 ->15 -> 9 -> 20 -> 12 -> 25 ->15 -> null

Remaining List : 18 -> 21 -> null
